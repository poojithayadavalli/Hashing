"""

Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are said to be symmetric if c is equal to b and a is equal to d. 

For example, (10, 20) and (20, 10) are symmetric. Given an array of n pairs find all symmetric pairs in it.

It may be assumed that the first elements of all pairs are distinct.

Constraints:
2<=n<=1000

Input:
Firstline indicates integer n
Next n lines indicates the pairs of elements

Output:
Print all the symmetric pairs

Example:

Input:
5
11 20
30 40
5 10
40 30
10 5

Output:
30 40
5 10
